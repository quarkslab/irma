Installation Checks
-------------------

Celery Workers
``````````````

Before going further, you should check that the python application manages to
communicate with the RabbitMQ server and the Redis server through Celery. To
ensure that, from the installation directory, execute the Celery worker:

On GNU/Linux:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /opt/irma/irma-frontend
    $ ./venv/bin/celery worker --app=frontend.tasks:frontend_app

     -------------- celery@frontend v3.1.23 (Cipater)
    ---- **** -----
    --- * ***  * -- Linux-3.2.0-4-amd64-x86_64-with-debian-7.6
    -- * - **** ---
    - ** ---------- [config]
    - ** ---------- .> app:         frontend.tasks:0x1e18750
    - ** ---------- .> transport:   amqp://probe:**@brain:5672/mqfrontend
    - ** ---------- .> results:     disabled
    - *** --- * --- .> concurrency: 2 (prefork)
    -- ******* ----
    --- ***** ----- [queues]
     -------------- .> frontend            exchange=celery(direct) key=frontend

    [2014-08-20 15:28:58,745: WARNING/MainProcess] celery@frontend ready.

If your Celery worker does not output something similar to the above output,
you should check twice the parameters in the application configuration file you
are using. Let us note that the Celery worker gives us useful information on
the analyzer that are enabled.

SFTP accounts
`````````````

Defaut File Transport Protocol since v1.4.0 is now SFTP, you can check whether the configured account is valid.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sftp <user>@<hostname of the brain>


FTP-TLS accounts
````````````````

Additionnally, if you have configured IRMA to use FTP-TLS, you can check
whether the configured account is valid. On Debian, this can be done with the
``ftp-ssl`` package:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install ftp-ssl
    [...]
    $ ftp-ssl <hostname of the brain>
    Connected to brain.

Restful API
```````````

One can verify that the restful API is up and running by querying a specific
route on the web server or by checking the system logs:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl http://localhost/api/v1.1/probes
    {"total": 9, "data": ["ClamAV", "ComodoCAVL", "EsetNod32", "FProt", "Kaspersky", "McAfeeVSCL", "NSRL", "StaticAnalyzer", "VirusTotal"]}

    $  sudo cat /var/log/supervisor/frontend_api.log
    [...]
    added /opt/irma/irma-frontend/venv/ to pythonpath.
