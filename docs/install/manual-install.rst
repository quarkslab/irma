Manual Install
==============

In some specific cases where automatic install is not possible, you should go with manual installation.

Each major component of the IRMA platform comes with their own python-based
application. As the **Brain** is the nerve center of the whole platform, it is
recommended to install it first before installing other components. One can then
install either the **Frontend** or the **Probes** he wants.

Please refer to specific documentation for the manual installation process for each
component.
