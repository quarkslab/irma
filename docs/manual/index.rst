Manual Installation
===================

.. warning:: Manual installation needs an update since 1.5.3
as all repositories layout have changed. Try Automated install or ask for
help on IRC.


In some specific cases where automatic install is not possible, you should go
with manual installation.

Each major component of the IRMA platform comes with their own python-based
application. As the **Brain** is the nerve center of the whole platform, it is
recommended to install it first before installing other components. One can then
install either the **Frontend** or the **Probes** he wants.

Please refer to specific documentation for the manual installation process for
each component.
