Installation
------------

**Probes** can be installed either on GNU/Linux and on Microsoft Windows
systems. The installation procedure may differs between the two systems.

.. _probe-install-source:

Downloading the source code from `github.com <https://github.com/quarkslab/irma-probe>`_
****************************************************************************************

The source code is hosted on github.com. One can fetch an up-to-date version
with the following commands. Let us note that there is a common submodule named
``irma-common`` that could be fetched automatically with the ``--recursive``
option:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/quarkslab/irma-probe


Prerequisites
+++++++++++++

We assume that you have a command line interface on your system [#]_ with
the following tools installed:

* python 2.7.x (see `Python for Windows <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_
  for prebuild MSI installer)
* python-pip (see `Install pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_
  for the recommended way to install pip package manager)

Furthermore, we assume that you have created an user ``irma`` that will be used
to run the python application.

.. note:: On GNU/Linux, one can create the user (and the group) ``irma`` with:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ sudo adduser --system --no-create-home --group irma


Installation on Microsoft Windows
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

On windows system, we will assume that the code for the **Probe** will be
installed at the root of the ``C:\`` drive, namely in ``C:\irma\irma-probe``.

Due to differences between Python for Windows and Python for Linux, the
installation with pip can only be done with the following command:

.. code-block:: none

    $ C:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install irma-probe-app-1.1.0.tar.gz --root="C:\irma\irma-probe"

However, this command puts the code source in ``C:\irma\irma-probe\Python27``
instead of ``C:\irma\irma-probe``. To fix this, either install
``irma-probe-app`` with ``pip`` and move the content of
``C:\irma\irma-probe\Python27`` to ``C:\irma\irma-probe\`` or simply copy the
code source you have just checked out from github.com in
``C:\irma\irma-probe``. Both methods should work.

Since the way we packaged the python application does not support
automatic installation of dependencies, we need to install them manually:

.. code-block:: none

    $ C:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install -r C:\irma\irma-probe\requirements.txt
    [...]


Installation on GNU/Linux
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

On GNU/Linux system, we will assume that the code for the **Probe** will be
installed in ``/opt/irma/irma-probe`` directory.


.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/quarkslab/irma-probe /opt/irma/irma-probe

We need few dependencies for future steps:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv python-dev


then, we need to install python dependencies manually in a virtualenv :

.. code-block:: bash

    $ virtualenv --system-site-packages /opt/irma/irma-probe/venv
    $ /opt/irma/irma-probe/venv/bin/pip install -r /opt/irma/irma-probe/requirements.txt
    [...]


If everything has gone well, the python application is now installed
on your system. The next step is to configure it for your platform and to
enable the analyzers you need.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] On Microsoft Windows, a Linux-like lightweight command line
       interface can be installed by installing
       `MSYS <http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS>`_.
