Purpose
-------

IRMA intends to be an open-source platform designed to help identifying and
analyzing malicious files.

However, today's defense is not only about learning about a file, but it is
also getting a fine overview of the incident you dealt with: where / when a
malicious file has been seen, who submitted a hash, where a hash has been
noticed, which anti-virus detects it, ...

An important value with IRMA comes from *you keep control over where goes and
who gets your data*. Once you install IRMA on your network, your data stays on
your network.

Each submitted files is analyzed in various ways. For now, we focus our efforts
on multiple anti-virus engines, but we are working on other "probes" (feel free
to submit your own).
