Development environment
-----------------------

This environment has been designed to help you to modify IRMA's components and
redeploy and test them. In this setup, everything is installed in a single
virtual machine with sources rsync-ed between the host and the guest. 

Requirements
````````````

- `Vagrant <http://www.vagrantup.com/>`_ 1.8 or higher has to be installed
- `Vagrant Hostmanager Plugin <https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/vagrant-hostmanager>`_
- As the installation work only for `Virtualbox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_,
  you will need to install it
- `Rsync <https://rsync.samba.org/>`_ to synchronize directories from host to VMs
- Read the `Ansible introduction <http://docs.ansible.com/intro.html>`_

Create the right environment
````````````````````````````

Clone IRMA repositories:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/quarkslab/irma-frontend
	$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/quarkslab/irma-brain
	$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/quarkslab/irma-probe

If you are interested in using `Vagrant <http://vagrantup.com>`_, be sure to have
the following directory layout:

.. code-block:: bash

	# all in the same directory
 	|
 	+--- irma-frontend
 	+--- irma-probe
 	+--- irma-brain
 	[...]
 	+--- irma-ansible

.. NOTE::

    This directory layout can be modified, see ``share_*`` variables from
    ``environments/dev.yml`` and ``environments/allinone_dev.yml`` files.

Run Vagrant and create your VMs
```````````````````````````````

For environments `allinone_dev` and `dev`, we recommand you to install
the Vagrant Hostmanager Plugin:
.. code-block:: bash

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager

It's used to modify `/etc/hosts` of your host, but also of all VMs.


As it use sudoer's rights, you may don't want to install it.
Then, please add to your `/etc/hosts` file and all of your VM:

for allinone_dev environment:
.. code-block:: bash

    172.16.1.30 brain.irma
    172.16.1.30 www.irma.local
    172.16.1.30 api.irma.local


To initialize and provision the Virtualbox VM, run ``vagrant up
--no-provision`` from the ``irma-ansible`` directory. The template will be
downloaded automatically and configured using ``environments/dev.yml`` file.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ VM_ENV=your_environment_name vagrant up --no-provision


.. NOTE::

    Optionally, if you want to use your own environment, create it in
    ``environments`` directory and run:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ VM_ENV=your_environment_name vagrant up --no-provision

Configure your .ini files
`````````````````````````

.. NOTE::

    You can bypass this step, as this provisioning is sync with default username
    and password used in (frontend|brain|probe) config files.

As your ``config/*.ini`` file are transferred from host to VMs, you will need
to modify them individually in the ``irma-frontend``, ``irma-probe`` and
``irma-brain`` repositories to match the user and password defined in
``playbooks/group_vars/*``.

Provision your VMs
``````````````````

Due to Ansible limitations using parallel execution, youâ€™ll need to launch the
provision Vagrant command only for one VM:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ vagrant provision frontend.irma

The provisioning and deployment will apply to all of your VMs.


Modify your host and open IRMA frontend
```````````````````````````````````````

Then, for proper use, update your `/etc/hosts` file and add:

.. code-block:: bash

	172.16.1.30    www.frontend.irma

Then, with your web browser, IRMA allinone is available at
`www.frontend.irma <http://www.frontend.irma>`_.

Sync files between host and guest
`````````````````````````````````

Once rsync is installed inside your virtual machine and your environment is correctly set. You could easily sync your code with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ vagrant rsync # or vagrant rsync-auto to automatically initiates an rsync
                    # transfer when changes are detected

Then, reload the modified application.
